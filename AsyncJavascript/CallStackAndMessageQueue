How Javascript Engine Executes Codes?

Javascript use two main datastructures to executes the code
1) CallStack
2) Message Queue


What the Heck is Event Loop?
How does Javascript Work?
A single threaded,  non blocking asycnhonous  concurrent language
I have call stack, event loop and callback queue and some other stuff


Ex:
Not Functional
var name = "Rahul"
var greeeting = "Hi, I am";
console.log(greeting + " "+name);

Functional 
function greet(name){
    return "Hi , I am "+name
}

greet('rahulsah');
=> Hi, I am Anjana
